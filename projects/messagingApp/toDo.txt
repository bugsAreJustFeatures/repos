1. make a basic form for now that allows me to log in and register 
    a. use backend passport local and then jwt to remain logged in
    b. this should display different things using the "signedIn" state variable ive made

2. then make it so when user is logged in the home page should be able to display messages and friends
    a. for now just make sure i can fetch them dont worry about styling and design
    b. i will come back to the home page when designing with css to make it show the design i drew the other day

3. figure this out later... just focus on 1 and 2 for now
