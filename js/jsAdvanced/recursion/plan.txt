merge sort plan

1. split array in half
2. if new array can be split
  2a. loop until array cannot be split anymore (length = 1)
3. compare first element in left and right arrays
4. remove the smallest element and push into a new array (merge)
5. loop through steps 3 and 4 until no elements left to sort.
